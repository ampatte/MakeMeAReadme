  ## Installation
  Before running this program Node.js and inquirer must be installed in the command line. The program is then initiated by entering node index.js in the command line.

  ## Usage
  This program was originally created as a class assignment. It will continue to be used to generate README's for future projects I create, and thus becoming a time saver.
